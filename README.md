# Bay Area Fog Visualizer – Setup Guide

This project contains a static web page that visualizes fog and low cloud
conditions over the San Francisco Bay Area using only map‑projected
tiles from the University of Wisconsin’s **RealEarth** platform.  Earlier
versions of this project included angled still images and animated
loops from NOAA; those have been removed so that the page now
displays a single, true overhead view of Northern California.  The
site automatically selects an appropriate satellite product for
daylight (GeoColor) or night (Night Microphysics), refreshes the
imagery every five minutes and offers a brightness slider for
nighttime viewing.



Enjoy your Bay Area Fog Visualizer!
